Easily monetise your content using the tallytoo button.

== Description ==
Tallytoo provides an ad-based content-monetisation service that you can integrate freely into your website.

Users earn points on the tallytoo platform, which they can then \'spend\' on your website. Tallytoo will pay you the equivalent amount in cash as the number of points spent on your site.

This plugin provides a pay-wall solution that uses the tallytoo button for monetising your content. All you need to do is create a free tallytoo account, integrate this plugin, and you can start monetising your content.
